This JavaScript code is for a quiz web application that shuffles questions, handles user interactions, and provides feedback based on the user's responses. Below is a breakdown of the key elements and functionalities:

Question Array:

An array of 10 questions (question_array) related to the World Economic Forum (WEF).
Each question has multiple choice answers, with the correct answer stored in an associated array (question_answer_correct_anser).
Shuffle Function:

shuffleArray is used to randomize the order of the questions.
Quiz Elements:

Various DOM elements are referenced, such as:
questions, quiz_card, playBtn, nextBtn, username, and tim_rem to manage quiz interaction and display.
answerButtons to store and manage the four possible answer buttons.
Event Listeners:

The playBtn listener starts the quiz after the user inputs their name. It displays the first question and starts the countdown timer.
The nextBtn listener loads the next question when clicked, checks the answer, and updates the score accordingly.
Answer buttons are enabled to check if the user's answer is correct and provide immediate feedback (green for correct, red for incorrect).
Quiz Flow:

After each question, the user must click "Next" to proceed. When all 10 questions are completed, the final score is displayed.
The quiz results can be reviewed by showing each question along with the correct answer and the user's answer.
Countdown Timer:

The quiz includes a timer that counts down from a set number of minutes (1 minute in this case). If the time runs out, the quiz ends, and the user's score is displayed.
Review Answers:

The user can review their answers and the correct answers after completing the quiz by clicking the review_ans button.
Responsive Design:

The quiz's visibility is controlled dynamically by showing and hiding specific elements (questions, final_score, etc.) during different phases of the quiz.
In summary, this code manages a quiz flow where users can answer questions, track their score, and review their performance, all within a timed setting.
